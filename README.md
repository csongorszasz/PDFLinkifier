# PDFLinkifier
Create table of contents with internal links for books with sheet music given in PDF format and make the song titles searchable.

## Guide
Pressing the <b><i>Select Files</i></b> button will bring up a window where you can select one or more <b><i>.pdf</i></b> documents.
<br>
Once you have selected the documents to process, the number of files selected is displayed next to the <b><i>Select Files</i></b> button.
<br>
Press <b><i>OK</i></b> to start the process, which will notify you when it is finished.
<br>
The processed files are named with the suffix <b><i>-processed</i></b>, while the original file remains untouched.
